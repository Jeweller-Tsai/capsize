	<h2>About</h2>


	<p>Amazon Web Services offers a compute power on demand capability known as the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).  Using the current <span class="caps">API</span>&#8217;s the compute resources in the cloud can be provisioned on demand by making <span class="caps">SOAP</span> or <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Query <span class="caps">API</span> calls to <span class="caps">EC2</span>.</p>


	<p><b>Legal Stuff : This project is in no way affiliated nor does it represent Amazon.com, Amazon Web Services, or the Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud service.</b></p>


	<p>This gem provides a plugin for the fantastic <a href="http://www.capify.org/">Capistrano 2</a> deployment and server management tool written by Jamis Buck.  With this gem, and Capistrano installed, you will be able to issue commands and script your interaction with Amazon&#8217;s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service.  This gem depends on the installation of the newly updated &#8216;amazon-ec2&#8217; Ruby Gem which is an interface library that can be used to interact with the Amazon <span class="caps">EC2</span> system using the Query <span class="caps">API</span> (as opposed to <span class="caps">SOAP</span>).</p>


	<h2>Project Info</h2>


	<p>This project is managed as a RubyForge project which you can find at <a href="http://capsize.rubyforge.org/">http://capsize.rubyforge.org/</a> and this is always the best place to find the latest news, report any bugs, submit feature requests, or provide patches.</p>

	<h2>Installing</h2>


	<p>This gem follows the standard conventions for installation on any system with Ruby and RubyGems installed.  If you have worked with gems before this will look very familiar.</p>


	<h3>Installation pre-requisites</h3>


	<p>Before you can make use of this gem you will need an <a href="https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html">Amazon Web Services developer account</a>.  This account must also be specifically enabled for Amazon <span class="caps">EC2</span> usage.  <span class="caps">AWS</span> will provide you with an &#8216;AWS Access Key ID&#8217; and a &#8216;Secret Access Key&#8217; which will allow you to authenticate any <span class="caps">API</span> calls you make and ensure correct billing to you for usage of the service.  Take note of these (and keep them secret!).</p>


	<h3>Installing the gem</h3>


	<p>Linux / <span class="caps">OS X</span> : <pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install capsize</pre></p>


	<p>Microsoft Windows : <pre syntax="ruby">gem install capsize</pre></p>


	<p>Note : This gem has a number of dependencies for runtime and testing.  It is recommended that you choose &#8216;Y&#8217; to install dependencies when asked by the gem install tool.</p>

	<h2>Credits</h2>


	<p>The original version of the Capistrano plugin gem was written by Jesse Newland.  This plugin (which shall remain un-named due to the trademark infringement cease and desist letter he received!) was a great start to using what was then a pretty weak amazon-ec2 gem library (I can say that since I wrote the first version based on Amazon Web Services sample code).  Jesse has graciously allowed us to merge his project with the the <span class="caps">EC2</span> gem and we are excited to have his help on the transition and helping to set the future direction of this gem.</p>
